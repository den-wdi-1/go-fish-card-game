# Go Fish - OO Ruby with Tests
<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/t0zfcej3qgZeE/giphy.gif" width=200>

In this lab you will be building a card game using Ruby Classes and Rspec Tests. Our game will include classes for: `PlayingCard`, `CardDeck`, `HandOfCards`, and `CardPlayer`. By the end of this lab you should be able to simulate a multi-player game of go_fish.

## Setup
First, make sure you've installed the `rspec` gem.

From the command line (inside the cloned repo directory) run:

```bash
gem install rspec # individually install the rspec gem
# or
bundle install # install all the gems listed in the Gemfile
```

Next, check that the rspec tests are working (they should be failing!):

```bash
rspec
# or
rspec spec/1_playing_card_spec.rb
# or, run only test that match your search
rspec spec/2_card_deck_spec.rb -e "shuffle"
```

## Building the Game

Take a look inside `go_fish.rb` and you'll see some boilerplate code for our classes.

#### Class Interfaces

Your classes will have the following interfaces:

| `PlayingCard` | `CardDeck`    | `HandOfCards` | `CardPlayer`  |
| :----         | :----         | :----         | :----         |
| `initialize`  | `initialize`  | `initialize`  | `initialize`  |
| `rank`        | `cards`       | `cards`       | `hand`        |
| `suit`        | `to_s`        | `to_s`        |               |
| `face`        | `shuffle`     | `shuffle`     |               |
| `to_s`        | `draw`        | `draw`        |               |
|               | `draw_one`    | `draw_one`    |               |
|               | `push`        | `push`        |               |
|               |               | `any?`        |               |
|               |               | `take!`       |               |

This will allow us to run "Driver Code" along the lines of:

```
# GAME SETUP

deck = CardDeck.new
deck.shuffle

card = deck.draw_one
two_cards = deck.draw(2)

cards1 = deck.draw(5)
h1 = HandOfCards.new(cards1)
p1 = CardPlayer.new(hand: h1)

cards2 = deck.draw(5)
h2 = HandOfCards.new(cards2)
p2 = CardPlayer.new(hand: h2 )


# GAME PLAY

wanted_rank = "3"
puts "p1, do you have any... #{wanted_rank}'s?"
if p1.hand.any?(rank: wanted_rank)
    cards = p1.hand.take!(rank: wanted_rank)
    p2.hand.push(*cards)
else
    puts "Go Fish"
    p2.hand.push(deck.draw)
end

```

#### Playing Cards
Your first goal will be to build your `PlayingCard` objects. Here's some raw data (no jokers!):

```ruby
RANKS = ["A", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10", "J", "Q", "K"]
SUITS = ["C", "D", "H", "S"]
SORTED_CARDS = [
    "AC", "AD", "AH", "AS", "2C", "2D", "2H", "2S", "3C", "3D", "3H", "3S",
    "4C", "4D", "4H", "4S", "5C", "5D", "5H", "5S", "6C", "6D", "6H", "6S",
    "7C", "7D", "7H", "7S", "8C", "8D", "8H", "8S", "9C", "9D", "9H", "9S",
    "10C", "10D", "10H", "10S", "JC", "JD", "JH", "JS", "QC", "QD", "QH", "QS",
    "KC", "KD", "KH", "KS"
]
```

**Follow the tests to get started!**

## Tips
You can run your game from the command line by typing:
```bash
ruby go_fish.rb
```

> **Hint**: Take a look at the "Driver Code" at the bottom of `go_fish.rb`!

You can also load your code into Pry to test your assumptions:
```bash
pry
> require 'go_fish.rb'
> card = Card.new({...})
> card.face # "AC"
```
